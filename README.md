#### Contribution Guidelines

    1. Create a New Branch: Before starting development, make sure to create a new branch from main for each feature or fix you want to work on. This helps in managing changes and makes it easier to create pull requests later on.

    2. Create a Pull Request: Once confident with your changes, create a pull request to the main repository and clearly explain the changes you've made.

    3. Collaboration and Feedback: Be prepared to collaborate with other contributors and accept feedback openly. This will help improve the quality and sustainability of the project.
